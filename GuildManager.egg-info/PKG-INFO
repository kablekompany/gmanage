        # guildmanager
        Simple and easy guild management for python discord bots!
        
        #### Why this package exists
        Mostly as a form of sync for our DragDev bots to use the same code (desync with the modules was a massive issue), however it seems the public 
        may find this useful.
        
        #### What is it's feature set?
        It has many commands and features, some of which are listed below:
          - Nice UI for listing servers
          - Embedded Pagination
          - In-depth analytics for gathering information on servers your bot uses
          - ability to access servers (via creating an invite) [or even remotely talking to users with our unique *Remote Access* chat feature.] (*coming soon*)
          - banning servers, and the ability to ban every server owned by a user.
          - server infractions, and limits
          - works per bot instance
          
         Much more will be coming as time moves on. Don't forget to keep the module updated!
         
        
        #### How do I use this?
        The [documentation](https://docs.dragdev.xyz/gm) explains it all.
        
        ### supporting us
        You can join our [discord server](https://beta.dragdev.xyz/r/server.html) and motivate us. ~~We don't take payments or donations unless you beg us to, which is 
        rather strange considering you would be begging to spend money.~~
        Turns out, we do accept payments. [click here](https://beta.dragdev.xyz/donate.html)
        
        ### FAQ:
        - Q: How do I make it so other users can run the guild manager's commands?
        * A: use the following code snippet to subclass the cog, and change the check:
        ```
        from guildmanager import cog
        class CustomGuildManager(cog.GMcog):
            async def cog_check(self, ctx: commands.Context):
                # just a regular @commands.check() function. see: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/api.html#discord.ext.commands.check
        ```
        then instead of `bot.load_extension("guildmanager")` do `bot.load_extension("path.to.the.file")` where path.to.the.file leads to the file `CustomGuildManager` is located.
        In fact, most things in the cog are subclassable. This can be useful if you want to change the ban message in `cog.py - guild_ban_check`.
        
        - Q: How can I use the utils this module comes with?
        * A: `from guildmanager.utils import ...` or `from guildmanager import utils`.
        ## quick install:
        ```

        python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager
        
        # Windows
        pip install git+https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager
        
        -- updating --
        # UNIX-based systems, like macos and linux distros:
        python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager --upgrade
        
        # Windows
        pip install git+https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager --upgrade
        ```
        ## quick load
        ```
        bot.load_extension("guildmanager.cog")
        ```
        
        ## Known issues loading:
        * Please read the wiki before loading, mainly [this page](https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager/wiki/Loading-before-bot-is-ready%3F)
        - [#1](https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager/issues/1) - Errors loading initially after install due to file issues [SOLVED]
        - [#2](https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager/issues/2) - Errors loading before bot is ready
        - [#9](https://github.com/kablekompany/guildmanager/issues/9) **OR** json.JSONdecodeError - an error occured during first load, to fix it all you need to do is delete the `guildmanager.data` file that is created in your active directory
        - [No issue] - Loading `guildmanager` only works on windows, whereas unix-based systems need to use `guildmanager.cog` directly.
